# Joins

Generate code to do these by creating an "AP"  database and table from the scripting files in the SampleSQLScripts module

Show results of queries via screen shots..

Note: If you are not using T-SQL, then you can just build  the tables( with maybe fewer attributes) from the T-SQL script and insert  3 or 4   rows to show that your  queries  work.
